Assumptions
=========================


1. This implementation handles only situations for cross-point with 2 alternative ways.
   The situations where a Robot finds cross points with up to 3 alternative paths are NOT supported
   because of not enough development time.
2. This algorithm was tested only with the provided maze sample, again because of time restrictions.
   Might be it does not function correctly when applied to other maze.
